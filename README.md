### üë§ Set Your Git Identity (First Time Only)
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Only needed the first time you use Git on your system.

If you haven‚Äôt configured Git before, run the following commands:
```bash or in same terminal type this 
git config --global user.name "Your Full Name"
git config --global user.email "your_github_email@example.com" 
```
You only need to do this once per computer ‚Äî Git will remember it for all future repositories.
